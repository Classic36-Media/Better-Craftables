Please open any support requests or feature requests on GitHub. Do not use the reviews to report bugs or suggest new recipes.

## Some things to note
* This datapack was thrown together a while ago for a small community, I figured others may enjoy the small changes it brings.
* I don't intend to update this pack with new recipes unless they are requested/worth adding or there are changes to the game that warrant new recipes.
* I will try to keep the pack up-to-date with the latest versions of Minecraft where possible.
